### Endfield_Font

EndfieldByButan is a font design based on hypergryph's original text appearing in the games Arknights and Arknights:Endfirld and their promotional materials. The font can be considered a re-creation of the IP Arknights.

Note that in order to make the font basically usable, I have added all of the following additional characters labeled blue. These characters have nothing to do with the possible settings of Arknights.

Hypergryph deserves the Final interpretation of this design.
